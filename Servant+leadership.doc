    <h1>Servant leadership</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p><strong style=3D"">Servant leadership</strong><span style=3D"col=
or: rgb(34,34,34);"><span>&nbsp;</span>is a leadership philosophy: Traditio=
nal leadership generally involves the exercise of power by one at the =E2=
=80=9Ctop of the pyramid.=E2=80=9D By comparison, the servant-leader shares=
 power, puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform=
 as highly as possible. Servant leadership turns the power pyramid upside d=
own; instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists t=
o serve the people. When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they =
unlock purpose and ingenuity in those around them, resulting in higher perf=
ormance and engaged, fulfilled employees.</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(34,34,34);">The 10 most important characterist=
ics of a servant leader:</span></p>
<h3 style=3D"" id=3D"Servantleadership-1.Listening">1. Listening</h3>
<p style=3D"">You'll serve people better when you make a deep commitment to=
 listening intently to them and understanding what they're saying. To impro=
ve your listening skills, give people your full attention, take notice of t=
heir body language, avoid interrupting them before they've finished speakin=
g, and give feedback on what they say.</p>
<h3 style=3D"" id=3D"Servantleadership-2.Empathy">2. Empathy</h3>
<p style=3D"text-align: left;">Servant leaders strive to understand other p=
eople's intentions and perspectives. You can be more<span>&nbsp;</span>empa=
thetic by putting aside your viewpoint temporarily, valuing others' perspec=
tives, and approaching situations with an open mind.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-3.Healing">3. Healing</h3>
<p>This characteristic relates to the emotional health and "wholeness" of p=
eople, and involves supporting them both physically and mentally. First, ma=
ke sure that your people have the knowledge, support and resources they nee=
d to do their jobs effectively, and that they have a healthy workplace. The=
n take steps to help them be happy and engaged in their roles.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-4.Self-Awareness">4. Self-Awareness</h3>
<p>Self-awareness is the ability to look at yourself, think deeply about yo=
ur emotions and behavior, and consider how they affect the people around yo=
u and align with your values.<br>You can become more self-aware by knowing =
your strengths and weaknesses, and asking for other people's feedback on th=
em. Also, learn to manage your emotions, so that you consider how your acti=
ons and behavior might affect others.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-5.Persuasion">5. Persuasion</h3>
<p>Servant leaders use persuasion =E2=80=93 rather than their authority =E2=
=80=93 to encourage people to take action. They also aim to build consensus=
 in groups, so that everyone supports decisions.<br>There are many tools an=
d models that you can use to be more persuasive, without damaging relations=
hips or taking advantage of others. You should also build your expert power=
 =E2=80=93 when people perceive you as an expert, they are more likely to l=
isten to you when you want to persuade or inspire them.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-6.Conceptualisation">6. Conceptualisation</h3>
<p>This characteristic relates to your ability to "dream great dreams," so =
that you look beyond day-to-day realities to the bigger picture.<br>If you'=
re a senior leader in your company, work through and develop a robust organ=
isational strategy. Then, whatever level you're at, create mission and visi=
on statements for your team, and make it clear how people's roles tie in wi=
th your team's and organisation's long-term objectives. Also, develop long-=
term focus so that you stay motivated to achieve your more distant goals, w=
ithout getting distracted.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-7.Foresight">7. Foresight</h3>
<p>Foresight is when you can predict what's likely to happen in the future =
by learning from past experiences, identifying what's happening now, and un=
derstanding the consequences of your decisions.<br>You can use tools such a=
s <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis" class=3D"external=
-link" rel=3D"nofollow">SWOT Analysis</a> to think about your current situa=
tion and environment, while <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenar=
io_analysis" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Scenario Analysis</a>=
 helps you understand how the future could play out.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-8.Stewardship">8. Stewardship</h3>
<p>Stewardship is about taking responsibility for the actions and performan=
ce of your team, and being accountable for the role team members play in yo=
ur organisation.<br>Whether you're a formal leader or not, you have a respo=
nsibility for the things that happen in your company. Take time to think ab=
out your own values, as well as those of your organisation, and where you s=
it with them. Also, lead by example by demonstrating the values and behavio=
urs that you want to see in others, and have the confidence to stand up to =
people when they act in a way that isn't aligned with them.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-9.CommitmenttotheGrowthofPeople">9. Commitment =
to the Growth of People</h3>
<p>Servant leaders are committed to the personal and professional developme=
nt of everyone on their teams.<br>To develop your people make sure that you=
 understand their developmental needs and give them the skills they need to=
 do their jobs effectively. Also, find out what their personal goals are, a=
nd see if you can give them projects or additional responsibilities that wi=
ll help them achieve these.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Servantleadership-10.BuildingCommunity">10. Building Community</h=
3>
<p>The last characteristic is to do with building a sense of community with=
in your organisation: You can do this by providing opportunities for people=
 to interact with one another across the company. <br>Encourage people to t=
ake responsibility for their work, and remind them how what they do contrib=
utes to the success and overall objectives of the organisation.</p>
