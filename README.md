# manager-README: An intro to me and my working style

## My managerial style, and what motivates me

I am not an authoritarian boss. I do not want to micro manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

My teams come first, the company comes second. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a well operating, well staffed, and well functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my success - so I will go out of my way to try and
make you successful.
I am without doubt busy with meetings most of the time. Regardless of how busy I am, nothing is more important than the time I can spend with you. If you need to chat then Slack me or put an appointment in my calendar. I have Slack on my phone; it might take a little while before I respond, but respond I will. Alternately my calendar is open and readable to all; find a slot and book it in, no need to ask. If you can't find time, I will make time.


## Stated Assumptions.

These are some assumptions I'm going to make:

1. You’re good at your job. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board / rubber duck. I am not here to tell you how to do your job.

2. I’m not good at your job. You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you.

3. You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

4. You feel safe debating with me. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I’m disagreeing I’m most likely just playing devil’s advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

5. Feedback is two-way. There are 3 main dimensions to good feedback:
    Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    Benefit should be high (positive results)



## One-to-ones
One-to-ones are very important to me because they are dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want. To that end, they are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you? 
They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me. 

It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status.
