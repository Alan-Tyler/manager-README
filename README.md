# manager-README: An intro to me and my working style

## My managerial style, and what motivates me

I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.

I am not an authoritarian boss. I do not want to micro manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

My teams come first, the company comes second. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a well operating, well staffed, and well functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my success - so I will go out of my way to try and make you happy, fulfilled and successful.
I am without doubt busy with meetings most of the time. Regardless of how busy I am, nothing is more important than the time I can spend with you. If you need to chat then Slack me or put an appointment in my calendar. I have Slack on my phone; it might take a little while before I respond, but respond I will. Alternately my calendar is open and readable to all; find a slot and book it in, no need to ask. If you can't find time, I will make time.

Incidentally, if I'm at my desk but have headphones on then it's quite likely that I'm just listening to some music - feel free to wave in my periphery to get my attemtion. If I'm on a call or similar then I'll gesticulate to indicate this. 

I believe in continuous improvement. On the mention of which, your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective. I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.

I am interested in continually iterating and fine-tuning these beliefs. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Likewise, if you see a discrepancy between this and my behavior, please tell me. 

To err is human (and to forgive, divine). I will make mistakes, and sometimes be wrong about things. There should be no ego invested about realising this, so don't feel shy about correcting me

"A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.” 

I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked with and without Agile; while I am a cerfified ScrumMaster and believe strongly in Agile principles, at the end of the day these are my values:

        I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.

        I value speed, including proactive efforts that keep us moving quickly (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor)

        I value learning, and know that training up on a tech stack may not always be the fastest route to production.

    I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc.


## Servant Leadership
Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy: Traditional leadership generally involves the exercise of control by one at the “top of the pyramid.” By comparison, the servant-leader puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Servant leadership turns the power pyramid upside down; instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they unlock purpose and ingenuity in those around them, resulting in higher performance and engaged, fulfilled employees. I believe managers work *for* their direct reports.

"What they do depends on the situation, which only they can judge"



## Stated Assumptions.

These are some assumptions I'm going to make:

1. You’re good at your job. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board / rubber duck. I am not here to tell you how to do your job (though you should always get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates).

2. I’m not good at your job. You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you.

3. You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

4. You feel safe debating with me. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I’m disagreeing I’m most likely just playing devil’s advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

5. Feedback is two-way. There are 3 main dimensions to good feedback:
    Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    Benefit should be high (positive results)



## One-to-ones
One-to-ones are very important to me because they are dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want. To that end, they are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you? 
They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me. 

It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status.




## How I can help you
Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can however provide feedback and an outside perspective. I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them; let’s work together on this.

At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.

You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I’ll answer. Very infrequently, I won’t be able to. But I’m committed to never lying to you.


Crew Resource Management
This is a philosophy that focus on the human dynamics of a team / squad 
We should cerlebrate success as a team, and learn from failure as a team aswell 
We do this by making sure that everyone has a voice
We need to avoid individuals developing dominant voices / taking over the conversation. No-one should be afraid to have input. 
 
I am accountable for the decisions the team make, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time
Attract and retain talent


measure everything you deliver in terms of how the customer will benefit from it
Spemnd time with Product, Marketing and Sales teams - they meet more customers than you.


Takw ownership - I always want to take the long-term view. Sacrificing long-term value for short-term gain will always end up biting you.
Bias for action - To quote Amazon: "Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study." It's not just OK top take calculated risks, I believe that we need to do so in order to innovate.
Always learning - I think it's important nto always be taking on board new techs, advancements, ways of working, etc. We should always stay curious.

Getting stuck in - You'll never hear me say "that's not my job"
