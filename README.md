## An intro to me and my working style

My managerial style, and what motivates me

I am not an authoritarian boss. I do not want to micro manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

My teams come first, the company comes second. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a well operating, well staffed, and well functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my success - so I will go out of my way to try and
make you successful.
I am without doubt busy with meetings most of the time. Regardless of how busy I am, nothing is more important than the time I can spend with
you. If you need to chat - find time on my calendar - no need to ask. If you can't find time, I will make time.
