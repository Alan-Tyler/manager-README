# manager-README: An intro to me and my working style

## My managerial style, and what motivates me

This document is some musings, maybe a little rambling attempt at summarising my professional beliefs and principles. It's not brilliantly set out: it's not supposed to be. It's a living document that changes as I change and grow as a manager and a person... So please do excuse the slight lack of narrative. But without further ado:

I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.

I am not an authoritarian. I do not want to micro-manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

My teams come first, the company comes second. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a well-operating, well-staffed, and well-functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my success - so I will go out of my way to try and make you as happy, fulfilled and successful as I can.
I am often busy. But regardless of how busy I am, nothing is more important than the time I can spend with you. If you need to chat then Slack me or put an appointment in my calendar. I have Slack on my phone; it might take a little while before I respond, but respond I will. Alternately my calendar is open and readable to all; find a slot and book it in, no need to ask. If you can't find time, I will make time.

Incidentally, if I'm at my desk but have headphones on then it's quite likely that I'm just listening to some music - feel free to wave in my periphery to get my attention. If I'm on a call or similar then I'll gesticulate to indicate this. 

I believe in continuous improvement. On the mention of which, your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective. I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.

To err is human (and to forgive, divine). I will make mistakes, and sometimes be wrong about things. There should be no ego invested about realising this, so don't feel shy about correcting me.

"A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.” 

I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked with and without Agile; while I am a certified ScrumMaster and believe strongly in Agile principles, at the end of the day these are my core values:

I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.

I value speed, including proactive efforts that keep us moving quickly (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor).

I value learning, and know that training up on a tech stack may not always be the fastest route to production.

I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc.


## Servant Leadership
Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy: Traditional leadership generally involves the exercise of control by one at the “top of the pyramid.” By comparison, the servant-leader puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Servant leadership turns the power pyramid upside down; instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they unlock purpose and ingenuity in those around them, resulting in higher performance and engaged, fulfilled employees. I believe managers work *for* their direct reports.

"What they do depends on the situation, which only they can judge"



## Stated Assumptions.

These are some assumptions I'm going to make:

1. You’re good at your job. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board / rubber duck. I am not here to tell you how to do your job (though you should always get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates).

2. I’m not good at your job. You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but except from rare / exceptional situations I won’t override you.

3. You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down, so please tell me.

4. You feel safe debating with me. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I’m disagreeing I’m most likely just playing devil’s advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

5. Feedback is two-way. There are 3 main dimensions to good feedback:
    Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
    Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
    Benefit should be high (positive results)



## One-to-ones
One-to-ones are very important to me because they are a dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want. They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me. It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status.

You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I’ll answer. Very infrequently, I won’t be able to. But I’m committed to never lying to you.


## Crew Resource Management
This is a philosophy that focuses on the human dynamics of a team / squad. 
We should celebrate success as a team, and learn from failure as a team as well. 
We do this by making sure that everyone has a voice.
We need to avoid individuals developing dominant voices / taking over the conversation. No-one should be afraid to have input. 
 
I am accountable for the decisions the team make, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time.


## I want to:
Attract and retain talent.

Measure what you deliver in terms of how the customer will benefit from it.

Take the long-term view. Sacrificing long-term value for short-term gain will always end up biting you.

Maintain a bias for action - To quote Amazon: "Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study." It's not just OK to take calculated risks; I believe that we actively need to do so in order to innovate.

Be always learning - I think it's important to always be taking on board new techs, advancements, ways of working, etc. We should always stay curious.

Be getting stuck in - You'll never hear me say "that's not my job".


## Personal quirks
I am loud: My hearing is badly damaged and it's difficult for me to regulate my vocal volume. I do try, but sometimes it slips a bit. If I'm too loud then tell me.

I argue with passion - sometimes I may go a bit red. I'm not getting furious, just passionate. If I cross a line or make you feel uncomfortable then tell me: this is most certainly never my intent.

I can repeat myself sometimes. Sometimes I'll re-word what I've said. I'll do this more often if I feel you weren't listening or didn't seem to understand the first time. If I'm annoying you or being boring by repeating myself then interrupt me and I'll move onto the next point. 

I like clean, self-documenting code, clean logs, clean exceptions, no broken windows. I might come across as a bit obsessed with this from time to time.

I believe strongly in the principles set out in The Toyota Way - if you haven't heard of this then do look it up; it's very interesting and while based on (automotive) manufacturing, the principles are directly transferrable and applicable to software engineering


## And finally
I'm a big believer in Google's 5 Dynamics of Successful Teams, that all teams should answer 'yes' to the following:
- Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
- Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
- Structure & clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
- Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
- Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?

I am interested in continually iterating and fine-tuning these beliefs. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Likewise, if you see a discrepancy between this and my behaviour, please tell me. 

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager.



## Suggested 1-2-1 format
A suggested (informal) agenda for 1-2-1s:


    Is there anything that needs clarity?
    What are you most proud of/excited about?
    What can I (your manager) improve on?
    Anything you think important that happened since the last 1-1
    What are potential troubles you see for the team
    What are potential troubles you see for the company
    What went well last week?
    What went not so well last week?
    Is there anything I can do to help?
    Anything non-work related worth mentioning?
    When x happened, what will you do differently next time?
    Have you identified any career development opportunities that I can help you with?
