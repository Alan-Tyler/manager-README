    <h1>Agile management</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p><a href=3D"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/effective-management-=
across-agile" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">https://www.atlassia=
n.com/agile/effective-management-across-agile</a></p>
<p>Agile teams are structurally different than their waterfall counterparts=
. Waterfall teams follow the structure of the organisation and scheduling i=
s often =E2=80=9Ctop down,=E2=80=9D meaning that management sets the pace a=
nd schedule. In agile development, the team is self-organising: It sets its=
 own schedule based on priorities from the product owner and the available =
capacity of the team.</p>
<p>Scrum masters and development managers bridge the organisational gap bet=
ween senior management and individual development teams. They work to optim=
ise teams and individuals to deliver the best quality software that further=
s company goals. The scrum master and the development manager also protect =
teams from outside distractions like feature creep, waterfall anti-patterns=
, cross-functional thrash, and side projects that distract from the team's =
true goals.</p>
<h4 id=3D"Agilemanagement-What'sadevelopmentmanager?">What's a development =
manager?</h4>
<p>Development managers are key participants in agile organisations and the=
ir role is substantial. They're responsible for the quality of the product,=
 from code architecture to end-user quality. They engage in code reviews to=
 ensure team members are contributing code that meets the short and long-te=
rm goals of the program, and because they're so close to the team they're u=
sually influential in the technology choices for the program. Combined, thi=
s proximity to the process and product allows dev managers to communicate c=
ontext internally for the team and externally to the larger organisation.</=
p>
<p>Great development managers are team builders, and that starts with hirin=
g. Development managers drive the hiring process and are well positioned to=
 do so because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring is time-consuming and distracting for the team</li>
<li>Searching for candidates takes focus away from building great products<=
/li>
<li>A development manager can help reduce some of the effects of on-boardin=
g as each new person integrates into the team</li>
<li>Put simply, when the development manager takes on the tasks of recruiti=
ng and hiring, the team is free to focus on the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development managers also act as a partner and mentor because they are a=
dept at the fundamentals of management: one-on-one meetings, giving feedbac=
k, and coaching. Successful development managers mentor engineers to bring =
greatness to the table: ideas, code, tests, and culture. At times, the team=
 will struggle with decisions ranging from architectural design to branchin=
g strategy; adept development managers know when to intervene, or let the t=
eam continue to struggle in order to learn.</p>
<p>Another big responsibility for development managers is to act as a partn=
er in the estimation process. In agile, the team sets the schedule because =
a fundamental tenet of agile is this: those closest to the work are best ab=
le to scope and deliver that work. The development manager adds value by as=
king questions and vetting assumptions made in the estimation exercise, but=
 would never dictate timelines to the team or change the scope without cons=
ulting the product owner. You won't hear "Find a way to get it done in four=
 weeks" in agile organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id=3D"Agilemanagement-What'sascrummaster?">What's a scrum master?</h4>
<p>Scrum masters are project leaders in an agile team who focus on optimisi=
ng performance, working between the product owner and the team to ensure co=
nsistent, successful sprints. Scrum masters also own cross-team coordinatio=
n so that the core team can focus on product development.</p>
<p>The goal of the scrum master is to keep everyone efficient and on the sa=
me page. As a result, the scrum master coordinates most of the inputs and o=
utputs required for an agile program. He or she drives the agile ceremonies=
 of sprint kick-off, daily stand-ups, sprint review, sprint retrospective, =
and works with the team and development managers to estimate larger items l=
ike epics and individual user stories in the backlog. The scrum master may =
not be as technical as the rest of the team, so the development manager can=
 step in to lend valuable context between the scrum master and the team whe=
n a knowledge gap appears. As the team matures in its application of agile,=
 the scrum master focuses less on estimation and more on optimising the vel=
ocity of delivery.</p>
<p>The scrum master also acts as an agile coach for the larger organisation=
, helping the team adopt and own agile practices throughout the product lif=
e cycle: story point estimation, sprint planning, and continuous delivery. =
The coaching aspect of the scrum master=E2=80=99s job is critical. As agile=
 experts, they know why agile is right for the project and the company, and=
 can be an advocate for agile when a company is working through the growing=
 pains of adopting it.</p>
<h4 id=3D"Agilemanagement-Scrummastersanddevelopmentmanagerspartnerinagilep=
ortfolios">Scrum masters and development managers partner in agile portfoli=
os</h4>
<p>Most waterfall teams are manager-centric: They look to managers to set p=
riorities, track progress, and evaluate performance. By contrast, agile tea=
ms are self-organising teams that own their roadmap and delivery. To make t=
his work for larger organisations, scrum masters and development managers w=
ork together to build an agile culture throughout the organisation and act =
as a buffer between teams and C-level management. Since both roles work acr=
oss multiple agile teams, they are key members of the agile portfolio.</p>
<p>Focus the scrum master on the team's adoption and implementation of agil=
e, and the development manager on hiring the right individuals, mentoring e=
xisting team members, and ensuring good development culture in every team. =
Both roles, working together, will foster high-functioning agile teams.</p>
